        <h1 class="text-danger display">An example of some projects that I have created are: </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://github.com/thewrightmeme/Stacks-And-Queues">---A Stacks and Queues Program---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We created a bathroom line and a truck fleet! We had to create code that operated like a stack or a queue. It was a bit difficult to code however, since we had to make it work with the logic of an actual bathroom line and truck fleet company. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://github.com/thewrightmeme/Recursive-Sorts">---A Recursive Sort Program---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We created merge sort and quick sort methods! The merge sort method divides, conquers, and merges elements into order. The quick sort method selects a pivot, partitions, and recursively sorts elements into order.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://mr-goldstein-s-computer-science-classes.github.io/deli-project-thewrightmeme/">---A Deli Website---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We created a fake deli website! You can order 2 pre-built sandwiches. You can also make a sandwich from scratch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://github.com/thewrightmeme/Sorts-">---A Normal Sort Program---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We created bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort methods! The hardest sort to make was bubble sort. The easiest one to make was insertion sort.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://github.com/thewrightmeme/LinkedList-">---A Linked List Program---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We created methods for creating a functioning linked list! Making a method that adds elements the list was really difficult. A linked list organizes data with nodes containing values and references.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://github.com/thewrightmeme/ArrayList">---A Array List Program---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We created methods for creating a functioning array list! It was the first program that I had made in 10th grade. It was extra difficult since I had sort of forgotten all of my coding knowledge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="display-5" href="https://thewrightmeme.github.io/Website-Practice/">---Practice Website---</a>
                <p class="text-success display-6">We made this to practice things in HTML and CSS (like BUTTONS)! It was very fun! It allowed me to express my creativity.</p>
            </li>
